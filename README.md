Please note that the content of this repository is currently **WORK IN PROGRESS**.

This Kubernetes network plugin uses FD.io VPP to provide network connectivity
between PODs. Currently, only Kubernetes 1.9.X versions are supported.


## Quickstart
You can get started with Contiv-VPP in one of two ways:
* Use the [Contiv-VPP Vagrant Installation][1] instructions to start a 
  simulated Kubernetes cluster with a couple of hosts running in VirtualBox
  VMs. This is the easiest way to bring up a cluster for exploring the 
  capabilities and features of Contiv-VPP.
   
* Use the [Contiv-specific kubeadm install][2] instructions to manually
  install Kubernetes with Contiv-VPP networking on one or more bare-metal
  or VM hosts.
